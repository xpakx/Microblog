# Microblog

## About
A simple microblogging service. That's my second program using Spring. Mainly why I write this program is that I want to better understand Spring Security, improve my unit tests and learn how to use Thymeleaf.

## Running Microblog

To run Microblog locally: 

```
  git clone https://github.com/xpakx/Microblog.git
  cd Microblog
  ./mwnw spring-boot:run
```

And then you can access microblog here: http://localhost:8080

## Database configuration

Microblog uses an MySql database. By default database's name is _test_, default username is _root_ and default password is empty. You can change them in src/main/resources/applocation.properties

## Demo
